The COVID-19 global vaccination tracker is an online tool that tracks the progress of COVID-19 vaccination efforts around the world. It provides information on the number of doses administered by vaccine type, the percentage of the population that has received at least one dose, and the percentage that has been fully vaccinated. It is often used by policymakers, public health officials, and researchers to inform decisions related to vaccine distribution and allocation.
